Introduction
============

A set of bindings to libX11, the graphics/windowing library for Unix. These
bindings will probably work with any version of X11 but were made with X11R6.

X11:
(require (planet "x11.ss" ("kazzmir" "x11.plt")))

Xpm:
(require (planet "x11-xpm.ss" ("kazzmir" "x11.plt")))

Example:
(require (planet "xsnow.ss" ("kazzmir "x11.plt")))
(run)
;; also (xsnow 200) for 200 snow flakes. run uses 100 snow flakes by default

_X11_
=========

The bindings follow the same semantics and overall style of the X11 library.
It is best to refer to the X11 documentation. Useful resources:
